## Background and Motivation

## Data

## Findings

Play around with Shiny App and include a few interesting instances of map/model output.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#import pre-wrangled data
model_data <- read_csv("model_data.csv")
map_data <- read_csv("map_data.csv")

#scatterplot and model output for percent married households
ggplot(data = model_data, aes(x = pct_married_hh, y = pct_pop_change)) +
      geom_point(aes(color = region, size = population)) +
      geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Percent Married Couple Households"
           ,y = "Percent Population Change 2013-2018") +
      theme_bw()
summary(lm(pct_pop_change ~ pct_married_hh, data = model_data))
```


## Limitations

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-Data-For-Good/ to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)

## Including code and plots

You can embed code as normal, for example:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
mosaic::favstats(~speed, data = cars)
```

Let's clean up the format of that output:

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Speed of car (mph)"
       , y = "Distance taken to stop (ft)"
       , title = "cars data (1920s)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
